# World Happiness Report Dashboard
This dashboard uses averages from the World Happiness Report data from 2016 through 2019. 
By integrating insights from economics, health, and public policy, the project aims to understand how these factors contribute to elevating happiness in each country and guide policy-making decisions.

### Dataset
Data Source: [World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness)

### Methodology
1. Data Collection
  - Source Identification: Identify reliable sources for the World Happiness Report data, including variables such as Happiness Score, GDP, Trust in Government, Life Expectancy, and other socioeconomic factors.
  - Data Acquisition: Download the datasets for multiple years to allow for temporal analysis.
2. Data Cleaning
  - Data Inspection: Examine the raw data for inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
  - Data Imputation: Handle missing data by appropriate methods such as mean imputation, interpolation, or using available data from other sources.
  - Normalization and Standardization: Normalize and standardize data to ensure consistency across different scales of measurement.
  - Data Integration: Merge datasets from different years and sources into a single, comprehensive dataset for analysis.
3. Data Analysis
  - Correlation Analysis: Perform statistical analyses to understand the relationship between Happiness Score and various socioeconomic factors (e.g., GDP, Trust in Government, Life Expectancy).
  - Trend Analysis: Analyze trends over the years to identify patterns and changes in happiness scores and their contributing factors.
  - Ranking: Rank countries based on their overall Happiness Score and identify the top 10 happiest countries.
4. Data Visualization
  - World Map Visualization: Create a world map highlighting the Happiness Score by country. Use color gradients to represent different happiness levels.
  - Interactive Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to: Drill down by year and country to view detailed factors contributing to the Happiness Score.
  - View correlations between GDP and other socioeconomic factors with the Happiness Score.
  - Identify trends and patterns over time.
  - Top 10 Countries Display: Visualize the top 10 countries with the highest Happiness Scores using bar charts or other suitable visual formats.
5.  Dashboard Development
  - Tool Selection: Choose a data visualization tool (e.g., PowerBI, Tableau) to develop the interactive dashboard.
  - Design and Layout: Design the layout of the dashboard to ensure it is user-friendly and provides clear, concise information.
  - Interactivity: Implement interactive elements such as filters, hover effects, and drill-down capabilities to enhance user engagement and analysis depth.

### Results and Conclusion
#### Results

1. Global Happiness Distribution: The interactive world map visualization effectively highlights the Happiness Score for each country. Clear geographical patterns emerge, with certain regions exhibiting consistently higher happiness scores.

2. Socioeconomic Factors Analysis:
  - GDP Correlation: The analysis confirms that while GDP is positively correlated with Happiness Score, it is not the sole determinant. High GDP does not always equate to high happiness.
  - Trust in Government: Countries with higher levels of trust in government tend to have higher Happiness Scores, indicating the importance of political stability and effective governance.
  - Life Expectancy: Higher life expectancy is strongly correlated with higher Happiness Scores, underscoring the significance of health and longevity in overall well-being.
  - Other Factors: Additional socioeconomic factors such as social support, freedom to make life choices, and generosity also show significant correlations with Happiness Scores.
3. Temporal Trends:
  - Year-over-year analysis reveals trends and shifts in Happiness Scores for different countries. Some countries show consistent improvement or decline, while others exhibit more volatile patterns.
  - External events (e.g., economic crises, political changes) can be seen impacting Happiness Scores in certain years.
4. Top 10 Happiest Countries: The visualization of the top 10 happiest countries provides insights into common characteristics shared by these nations. Typically, these countries have strong economies, effective governance, high life expectancy, and robust social support systems.

5. Country-Specific Insights: The ability to drill down by country and year provides detailed insights into the factors affecting happiness in individual countries. For example, in some countries, improvements in healthcare or political reforms are linked to significant increases in Happiness Scores.
Conclusion

#### Key conclusions include:

  - Multifaceted Nature of Happiness: Happiness is influenced by a complex interplay of factors beyond just economic prosperity. Effective governance, healthcare, social support, and personal freedoms play crucial roles.
  - Policy Implications: Policymakers should adopt a holistic approach to improve happiness and well-being. Economic growth should be complemented by investments in healthcare, education, social support, and governance reforms.
  - Country-Specific Strategies: Each country has unique challenges and strengths. Tailored strategies addressing specific socioeconomic factors are essential for improving Happiness Scores.
  - Value of Data-Driven Insights: The use of interactive dashboards and data visualization tools like PowerBI or Tableau enhances the ability to analyze and interpret complex data, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

By leveraging these insights, governments, organizations, and researchers can better understand the determinants of happiness and work towards creating environments that foster well-being and satisfaction for their populations.
